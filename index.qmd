# Prior to using nbdev, documentation was the most cumbersome aspect of our software development process...<br><br>We would typically write and test code snippets in a notebook, author prose in a markdown editor, and then manually merge the two. We find that the best way to showcase software is a blend of prose and code, but the cumbersome process of copy-paste makes it time-consuming to create rich narratives with many interspersed code examples. Worst of all, the process is error-prone, leaving a high probability of publishing documentation that is broken. Using nbdev allows us to spend more time creating rich prose around the many code snippets guaranteeing the whole experience is robust.<br><br>nbdev has turned what was once a chore into a natural extension of the notebook-based testing we were already doing.

# I use this in production at my company. It's an awesome tool. Personally, when I'm coding in Python, I like to prototype in Jupyter, copy code over, and then reimport anyway. nbdev streamlines everything so I can write docs, tests, and code all in one place. And since the docs are just a Jekyll [now Quarto] site, I can copy it to our documentation AWS bucket in continuous integration. And with one command, I can run all the notebook tests in CI as well. The packaging is also really well thought out. I don't have to stress out about connecting setup.py with whatever publishing system we have. The settings.ini makes things sane, and I can bump the version whenever I want.<br><br>I get a lot of skeptical looks when I say the source code is in notebooks, but that's just syntactic sugar for the raw source code. You still get to edit the raw code files and with one command sync everything with the notebooks. From my point of view it is close to a Pareto improvement over traditional Python library development.

# We’re so excited about using nbdev. Our product is technical so our resulting documentation includes a lot of code-based examples. Before nbdev, we had no way of maintaining our code examples and ensuring that it was up-to-date for both command inputs and outputs. It was all manual. With nbdev, we now have this under control in a sustainable way. Since we’ve deployed these docs, we also had a situation where we were able to identify a bug in one of our interfaces, which we found by seeing the error that was output in the documentation.

# Nbdev has transformed the way we write documentation. Gone are the days of worrying about broken code examples when our API changes or due to human errors associated with copying & pasting code into markdown files. The authoring experience of nbdev is also powerful, allowing us to write prose and live code in a unified interface, which allows more experimentation with technical content. On top of this,  nbdev allows us to include unit tests in our documentation which mitigates the burden of maintaining the docs over time.
